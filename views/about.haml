%h2 About
%p kc.io is a free job board for the Kansas City Web/Tech community.  I started messing around with Ruby & Sinatra and this is what happened.  It is a work   in progress, and definintely needs a lot of work.  But, in the spirit of "releasing early & often," I figured I'd throw it out there.  Use it, Mock it, Hack it, Ignore it.   You pick.  The code is up on Github if you wanna tinker.

%p I know there are a lot of job sites out there, but this one is built specifically for the KC Startup community for jobs that sit at the intersection of Web/Marketing/Tech. If anyone else in the KC Startup community thinks it might be useful, let me know.  We can build a couple of features on top of it to make it useable (i.e, a real submission form with resume upload, user & customer profiles, better authentication framework, etc)

%p If you're interested in a super clean ruby framework that'll give you just the basics and allow you to build simple ruby apps, I'd highly recommend it. You can check it out here:
